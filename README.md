This project provides an automated solution for translating Android Studio strings.xml files into multiple languages.

## Usage

2. **Define Languages:**
   - Edit [./input/languages.csv](./input/languages.csv) to specify the languages you want to translate to. Separate each language code with commas
   - List of Possible values defined by the [ISO 639 (Set 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) (Some languages like chinese have multiple values, like zh-CN, zh-TW, etc.)

3. **Run the Translation Script:**
   - Execute the `translate.py` script.

4. **View Translations:**
   - Translated files will be generated in the `./output/` folder, with each translation in a separate file.
